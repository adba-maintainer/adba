# Australian Data Breach Archive

A community-driven public interest project providing a comprehensive public register of cybersecurity incidents affecting Australians, with a strong emphasis on data breaches.

## About

The Australian Data Breach Archive documents data breaches, DDoS attacks, ransomware incidents, and other significant cybersecurity events that have impacted Australian individuals and organisations. This archive serves as a public resource for understanding the landscape of data security incidents in Australia.

### Project Goals

- **Transparency**: Make information about Australian data breaches accessible to the public
- **Education**: Help Australians understand the risks and impacts of data breaches
- **Accountability**: Create a permanent public record of cybersecurity incidents
- **Public Interest**: Serve as a resource for researchers, journalists, and policy makers

## Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documents incidents from 2000 onwards
- **Structured Data**: Standardised metadata including severity classifications, affected data types, and attack vectors
- **Plain Language**: Written for general public consumption, avoiding technical jargon
- **Authoritative Sources**: Links to official disclosures from OAIC, ACSC, and other government agencies
- **Searchable**: Full-text search across all breach entries
- **Taxonomies**: Browse by industry sector, year, or severity level

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` (TBD) for detailed guidelines.

## Data Sources

The archive draws from:

- **OAIC** (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner) Notifiable Data Breach reports
- **ACSC** (Australian Cyber Security Centre) alerts and advisories
- Australian media reports from authoritative sources
- Company disclosures and public statements
- Court documents and regulatory filings

## Severity Classification

Breaches are classified using a three-tier system:

- **Minor**: <50,000 affected, contact information only, limited impact
- **Serious**: 50k-1M affected OR critical services OR high-sensitivity data
- **Severe**: >1M affected OR critical infrastructure OR government IDs at scale
