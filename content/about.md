### Mission Statement
The **Australian Data Breach Archive (ADBA)** is a public-interest project dedicated to maintaining a permanent, searchable record of cybersecurity incidents affecting Australian organizations.

While news cycles move on quickly, the impact of a data breach on a consumer's identity can last for years. This archive exists to ensure that information regarding what was lost, when it happened, and who was responsible remains accessible to the public long after the headlines fade.

### How to use this Archive
This site is designed as a **historical ledger**, not an emergency response tool.

1.  **Search for the Entity:** Use the search function or browse by sector to find the organization that contacted you.
2.  **Verify the Date:** Scammers often recycle old news. Ensure the breach notification you received matches the dates listed here.
3.  **Check the Data Types:** Review the "Data Types" field to understand exactly what information was exposed (e.g., if "Passport Number" is not listed, you likely do not need to replace your passport).

### Disclaimer & Methodology
This is an independent, non-commercial project maintained by Australian systems engineers.

* **Source of Truth:** All records are compiled from publicly available disclosure statements, ASX announcements, and reports from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).
* **Verification:** Every entry includes a link to the original source or an archived copy (Wayback Machine) to preserve evidence.
* **Not Legal Advice:** The information provided here is for educational and archival purposes only. For official advice, please consult [Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au) or [IDCARE](https://www.idcare.org).
