## Summary

Australian automotive manufacturer Clutch Industries confirmed a cyber incident in January 2025 after the Lynx ransomware group listed the company on its darknet leak site. The attackers claimed to have exfiltrated 350 gigabytes of data including business records, employee information, and financial details.

On 19 January 2025, the Lynx ransomware gang listed Clutch Industries as a victim on their darknet platform, claiming to have stolen 350 gigabytes of data.

Initial assessments suggest limited personal data was involved in the breach.
