## Summary

The Akira ransomware group claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on Regency Media, a defunct Australian media company that dissolved in 2023. The attackers claimed to have stolen over 16 gigabytes of data including employee and customer personal information, identity documents, and financial records from legacy systems that remained online after the company's closure.

## What Happened

In mid-February 2025, Regency Media was listed on Akira's darknet leak site. The ransomware group claimed to have stolen data including non-disclosure agreements, driver licences, passports, contact numbers and email addresses of employees and customers, and financial data such as audits, payment details, and reports. Regency Media, which produced discs, VHS tapes, and audio cassettes for Australian entertainment companies, had dissolved in 2023, but legacy systems containing sensitive data remained accessible online.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach potentially affects former employees and customers of Regency Media whose personal information, including identity documents and contact details, remained on the company's legacy systems. The exact number of affected individuals has not been disclosed.

## Organisational Response

As Regency Media dissolved in 2023, there was no active organisation to respond to the incident. This case highlights the security risks posed by legacy systems and data that persist after company closures, particularly when such systems are no longer monitored or secured.
