## Summary

Christian Community Aid, a registered charity based in Eastwood, New South Wales, was listed as a victim by the Space Bears ransomware gang in January 2025. The attack threatened to disrupt vital services provided by the organisation, which serves nearly 5,000 community members and families annually through aged care, disability support, family day care, and child and family services. The ransomware group gave the organisation a 10-day deadline before threatening to release stolen data.

## What Happened

The Space Bears ransomware group listed Christian Community Aid on their dark web leak site in January 2025, claiming to have compromised the NSW-based charity. The gang, believed to be based in Russia, threatened to release stolen data if their ransom demands were not met within 10 days.

Christian Community Aid provides essential community services including aged care, family day care, disability support, community learning and support, and child and family services. According to the organisation's 2023-24 Annual Report, CCA helped 4,928 community members and families, including 601 community learning students, and employed 322 volunteers.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach potentially exposed data relating to vulnerable community members who rely on CCA's services, including:
- Aged care recipients
- Disability support clients
- Children and families using day care and family services
- Community learning students
- Volunteers

The attack reportedly disrupted vital services provided by the community organisation, potentially affecting thousands of people who depend on these essential support services.

## Organisational Response

Christian Community Aid has not publicly commented on the incident. The organisation has not disclosed whether they engaged with the ransomware operators, paid the ransom, or what specific data may have been compromised.
