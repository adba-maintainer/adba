## Summary

Pressure Dynamics, a Western Australia-based hydraulics company serving the oil and gas, offshore production, and defence sectors, suffered a ransomware attack by the DragonForce gang in June 2025. The attackers published over 106 gigabytes of stolen data on darknet leak sites, including historical site and customer reports, detailed technical drawings, and employee medical records.

## What Happened

On 17 June 2025, the DragonForce ransomware gang listed Pressure Dynamics on its darknet leak site and published over 106 gigabytes of exfiltrated data. The stolen information included historical site and customer reports, detailed technical drawings of equipment, and employee pathology and medical reports. DragonForce operates a ransomware-as-a-service platform, allowing affiliates to use their ransomware in exchange for up to 80 per cent of ransom payments, and commonly advertises on Russian-language hacking forums.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed sensitive employee information, including pathology and medical records. The company serves critical infrastructure sectors including oil and gas, offshore production, and defence, raising concerns about potential exposure of sensitive technical information and client data. Pressure Dynamics operates four offices across Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland.

## Organisational Response

Pressure Dynamics confirmed the DragonForce ransomware attack. The company, which provides hydraulic, lifting, and electro-mechanical integrity solutions to sensitive sectors, has not made additional public statements regarding the incident or remediation efforts.
