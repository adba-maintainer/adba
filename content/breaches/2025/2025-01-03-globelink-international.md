## Summary

Globelink International, an Australian freight forwarding company, suffered a ransomware attack by the Qilin ransomware operation in December 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen 22 gigabytes of data comprising nearly 30,000 files, including financial records, debtor and creditor information, and bank statements. The stolen data was made available for download on 3 January 2025.

## What Happened

The Qilin ransomware group gained unauthorised access to Globelink International's network in December 2024 and exfiltrated 22 gigabytes of company data. On 23 December 2024, a Qilin affiliate reported the breach, and by 3 January 2025, all stolen data was made available for download on their dark web leak site.

The stolen data comprised 29,843 files including sensitive financial information such as details of the company's debtors and creditors, bank statements, and other internal business documents. According to reports, very little personal information appears to have been compromised in the breach.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach primarily exposed business and financial information rather than personal data. While very little personal information was reportedly compromised, any employees or business contacts whose details were included in the stolen files face potential privacy concerns.

## Organisational Response

Globelink International, which has offices throughout Australia and is part of the wider Globelink International Group headquartered in Singapore, has not publicly commented on the incident. The company did not respond to media requests regarding the breach or its response measures.
