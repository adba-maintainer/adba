## Summary

Ingram Micro, a global IT distributor, suffered a ransomware attack on 3 July 2025 that disrupted operations across all regions including Australia. The SafePay ransomware gang gained access through the company's GlobalProtect VPN platform using leaked credentials, crippling core platforms including the AI-powered Xvantage system and Impulse licence provisioning platform. The company restored operations approximately four days after the attack.

## What Happened

On 3 July 2025, Ingram Micro detected ransomware on certain internal systems. The SafePay ransomware gang, a newly emerging threat group active since November 2024 and identified as the most active ransomware group in May 2025, infiltrated Ingram Micro's network through its GlobalProtect VPN platform using leaked credentials. The attack disrupted core platforms including the flagship AI-powered Xvantage platform and the Impulse licence provisioning platform, halting order processing and shipments globally. Upon discovery on 5 July 2025, Ingram Micro proactively took certain systems offline and implemented mitigation measures.

## Impact on Individuals

The attack caused significant supply chain disruption affecting Ingram Micro's global customer and partner base, including Australian businesses. Order processing and shipments were halted across all regions. Australian customers and partners received communications about the "system outage," with the Australian website remaining in maintenance mode during the incident. The disruption lasted approximately four days before operations were restored.

## Organisational Response

Ingram Micro promptly secured the affected environment by proactively taking certain systems offline and implementing mitigation measures. The company launched an investigation with leading cybersecurity experts and notified law enforcement. Operations were restored across all countries and regions approximately four days after the initial attack. The company communicated with customers and partners throughout the incident, with Australian operations managed by executive managing director Hope McGarry.
