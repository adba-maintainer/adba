## Summary

The KillSec ransomware gang listed the Albright Institute of Language and Business on its darknet leak site in February 2025, threatening to publish stolen student and business data. The attackers posted sample data including passport scans, visa application documents, study offer letters, payment plans, and detailed student records.

## What Happened

In February 2025, KillSec claimed a cyber attack on the Albright Institute, a registered training organisation that provides English language training and business qualifications to prepare students for Australian university study. The ransomware group gave the institution six days before publishing the stolen data. Sample data released by the attackers included passport scans, study offer letters, payment plan documents, visa application materials, and comprehensive student records containing names, school IDs, email addresses, mobile numbers, qualifications, unit assessments, deadlines, and results.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed sensitive personal information of students, including identity documents, visa materials, contact details, and academic records. The full extent of affected individuals has not been publicly disclosed.

## Organisational Response

The Albright Institute has not made public statements regarding the incident. KillSec, which was identified as responsible for the highest number of ransomware attacks globally in January 2025, has been particularly active targeting organisations in the Australia-New Zealand region since November 2024.
