## Summary

Townsville City Council in Queensland disclosed in July 2018 that personal details of residents who had entered an art competition or completed council surveys may have been compromised through the Typeform breach. The council had used Typeform, an online form platform, to collect competition entries and gather public feedback. When Typeform's systems were hacked, information from council forms was potentially accessed by attackers.

## What Happened

Attackers breached Typeform's systems in late June 2018, compromising data from forms created by Typeform's customers, including Townsville City Council. The council had used Typeform for various community engagement activities, including an art competition and public consultation surveys.

The compromised information included personal details that residents had submitted when entering the art competition or participating in council surveys, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses. The breach occurred in Typeform's systems, not the council's own IT infrastructure.

Typeform notified the council of the security incident in early July, and the council promptly notified potentially affected residents. The incident was part of the broader Typeform breach that affected multiple Australian government agencies and organisations simultaneously.

## Impact on Individuals

Residents who had participated in council activities via Typeform faced minor risks:

- **Contact information exposed**: Names, email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses
- **Community engagement context**: Information provided for art competitions or public consultations
- **No sensitive government data**: No rates information, property details, or identity documents
- **Limited fraud potential**: Contact details alone pose relatively low risk

Potential impacts included:
- Spam or unwanted communications using exposed contact details
- Minor privacy concern from disclosure of competition or survey participation
- Potential for targeted scams using knowledge of council engagement

## Organisational Response

Townsville City Council responded appropriately to the third-party breach:
- Notified affected residents promptly after being informed by Typeform
- Published public notice about the breach on the council website
- Explained the circumstances and that council systems were not directly compromised
- Advised residents to be cautious of suspicious communications
- Reviewed use of third-party platforms for community engagement

The council's transparent communication demonstrated responsible handling of a vendor security incident affecting constituents.

## Local Government Digital Services

The incident highlighted issues facing local councils using digital tools for community engagement:

- **Community participation**: Councils increasingly use online platforms for public consultation
- **Vendor dependence**: Reliance on third-party services for cost-effective digital tools
- **Limited IT resources**: Smaller councils may lack resources to build custom solutions
- **Public trust**: Breaches affecting government services can undermine community confidence
- **Data stewardship**: Councils' responsibility to protect resident information even when using external platforms

Local councils face unique challenges balancing the benefits of accessible digital engagement tools with data security obligations and limited budgets.

## Typeform Multi-Organisation Impact

Townsville Council was one of several affected organisations in the July 2018 Typeform breach:
- Tasmanian Electoral Commission (voter data)
- Cairns Regional Council (public surveys)
- Bakers Delight (competition entries)
- Airtasker (user feedback)

The simultaneous impact on multiple councils and organisations demonstrated how third-party platform breaches create cascading effects across different sectors and jurisdictions.

## Government Use of Cloud Platforms

The breach contributed to discussions about government use of commercial cloud services:

- **Procurement considerations**: Need to assess vendor security in procurement decisions
- **Data sovereignty**: Questions about storing government data on international platforms
- **Cost vs security**: Balancing affordable tools with security requirements
- **Contractual protections**: Importance of agreements addressing vendor breaches
- **Alternative solutions**: Considering government-hosted or Australian platforms

## Community Engagement Implications

The incident affected how councils approach digital community engagement:

- **Platform selection**: Greater scrutiny of tools used for public consultation
- **Data collection**: Reviewing what information is necessary for engagement activities
- **Risk assessment**: Evaluating whether benefits of convenient platforms outweigh risks
- **Resident expectations**: Understanding that even simple participation creates data security obligations

## Comparison to Electoral Breach

The Townsville Council breach occurred shortly after the Tasmanian Electoral Commission Typeform breach, but with different implications:

- **TEC**: High-sensitivity (voter data, driver's licences) → Serious breach
- **Townsville**: Low-sensitivity (competition entries, surveys) → Minor breach

This demonstrated that breach severity depends on data sensitivity, not just the platform or number affected.

## Long-term Impact

The Townsville City Council Typeform breach contributed to:
- Enhanced awareness among local governments about third-party platform risks
- Development of vendor security assessment processes for council procurement
- Recognition that community engagement tools involve data protection obligations
- Greater caution in collecting personal information for council activities

While the direct impact on residents was minor, the incident served as a learning experience for local governments about the security implications of digital community engagement tools and the importance of vendor security assessment.
