## Summary

In September 2024, I-MED Radiology Network, Australia's largest medical imaging provider, exposed tens of thousands of patient files online for over a year through a misconfigured online referrer portal. Patient medical imaging records and personal information were accessible using details that had been shared publicly online.

## What Happened

I-MED's online referrer portal was misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to patient medical imaging files using publicly available credentials that had been shared online for over a year before discovery.

## Impact on Individuals

Tens of thousands of I-MED patients had medical imaging records and associated personal health information exposed, creating severe privacy violations and potential discrimination risks.

## Organisational Response

I-MED acknowledged the security issue and remediated the portal configuration after the exposure was discovered.
