## Summary

Advance Press, a Western Australia-based printing organization, was breached by the Ransom House threat group in May 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen approximately 300GB of data and threatened to leak or sell the information if ransom demands were not met.

## Attack Vector

Ransom House, a threat group that emerged in December 2021, infiltrated Advance Press systems and exfiltrated approximately 300GB of company data. The group posted sample stolen data to substantiate their claims and issued threatening messages urging the company to address the situation to prevent data leakage or sale to third parties.

## Consumer Impact

The stolen data contains files spanning from 2010 to 2024, including employment contracts, résumés, insurance documents, expenses, budgets, and profit and loss margins. Given Advance Press works with major clients including the Australian government and several Fortune 500 companies, the breach potentially exposes sensitive business relationships and confidential commercial information across multiple high-profile organizations.

## Response

No public response from Advance Press has been documented at the time of the breach disclosure. The company, previously part of the Geon group, has not issued public statements regarding remediation efforts or customer notifications.
