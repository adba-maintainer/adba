## Summary

Meshworks, a Sydney-based Australian steel fabricator manufacturing welded wire mesh products, was listed on the Sarcoma ransomware gang's dark web leak site on October 30, 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen 8 gigabytes of business data.

## Attack Vector

The Sarcoma ransomware group, which emerged in October 2024, breached Meshworks' network and exfiltrated company data. Sarcoma posted sample stolen data including business documents with supplier names and addresses, employee leave hour records, and financial information relating to tax returns. The attack was part of Sarcoma's debut campaign targeting multiple Australian businesses.

## Consumer Impact

Meshworks manufactures steel welded wire mesh for mining, construction, rural, fabrication, safety, storage, temporary fencing, and materials handling industries. The 8GB data theft exposed supplier relationships, employee records, and financial documentation. As one of four Australian companies targeted by Sarcoma in its initial October campaign, the breach demonstrates the group's focus on manufacturing and industrial sectors.

## Response

No public response from Meshworks has been documented at the time of the dark web leak site posting. The attack occurred during Sarcoma's emergence as a new ransomware threat, with the group listing approximately 30 victims totaling over 5 terabytes of claimed data theft in its initial operations.
