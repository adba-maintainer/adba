### Summary

Meli, a North Geelong-based community support service, was hit by a Qilin ransomware attack on 21 August 2024. The attackers stole 215 gigabytes of data (419,617 files), including financial statements, confidentiality agreements, passport scans, and Medicare cards. The organization operates over 30 kindergartens and provides family support and foster care services in the Geelong region.

### What Happened

The Qilin ransomware group breached Meli's systems and exfiltrated 215GB of sensitive data over multiple days. As soon as the incident was detected, Meli took immediate steps to secure their systems and engaged forensic specialists and cybersecurity advisors to investigate. The stolen data included financial records, confidential agreements, and scans of government identity documents including passports and Medicare cards.

### Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed highly sensitive government identity documents including passports and Medicare numbers. These documents can be used for serious identity theft and fraud. Affected individuals should:

- Monitor their Medicare statements for unauthorized claims
- Check passport status through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
- Consider placing a ban on their credit file
- Be vigilant for phishing attempts targeting families using Meli's services
- Watch for suspicious activity related to children's services or family support programs

### Organisational Response

Meli immediately notified Victoria Police, Victoria Health, the Australian Cyber Security Centre, and other relevant government agencies. The organization worked with forensic specialists to investigate the breach and strengthen security. Client services continued as normal, though some internal processes were temporarily affected. Meli was formed in 2023 through a merger of Bethany and Barwon Child, Youth & Family community support services.
