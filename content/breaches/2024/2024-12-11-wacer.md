## Summary

In December 2024, the Funksec ransomware gang, a new operation that emerged earlier that month, claimed attacks on two Australian organizations: WACER, a West Australian cleaning supplier, and the Fresh Produce Safety Centre Australia & New Zealand, a University of Sydney-affiliated not-for-profit. Despite the claims, Funksec released only minimal, primarily publicly available data, raising questions about the authenticity and scale of the alleged breaches.

## What Happened

Funksec, a ransomware group that posted its first victim in December 2024, quickly established itself as an active threat by listing 50 incidents globally within its first month. The group targeted WACER, a Western Australian cleaning products and services supplier, alongside the Fresh Produce Safety Centre Australia & New Zealand (FPSC-ANZ).

FPSC-ANZ, established in 2013, is a collaborative not-for-profit hub connecting stakeholders across the fresh produce supply chain, including growers, packers, and regulatory bodies in Australia and New Zealand. The organization focuses on enhancing fresh produce safety standards.

Despite Funksec's claims, the leaked data consisted primarily of non-sensitive, publicly available material rather than confidential business information or personal data, suggesting either limited access or an unsuccessful attack.

## Impact on Individuals

The minimal data release suggested limited impact on individuals. No sensitive personal information or confidential business data appeared in the published materials.

## Organisational Response

Neither WACER nor FPSC-ANZ issued public statements confirming or denying the Funksec claims.
