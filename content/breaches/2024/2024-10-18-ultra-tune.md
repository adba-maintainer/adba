## Summary

Ultra Tune, a major Australian automotive service franchise operating over 270 service centers nationwide, was listed on the Fog ransomware group's dark web leak site on October 18, 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen 3 gigabytes of sensitive employee and customer data.

## Attack Vector

The Fog ransomware group, a variant of the STOP/DJVU family active since 2021, breached Ultra Tune's systems and exfiltrated approximately 3GB of data. Fog ransomware is known for rapid encryption capabilities and double extortion tactics, targeting various sectors including automotive services, education, healthcare, and finance.

## Consumer Impact

The compromised data includes driver licenses, passports, medical certificates, human resources records, personal data of employees, and customer contact details. The exposure of identity documents combined with medical certificates creates significant identity theft risk for affected employees and customers across Ultra Tune's extensive 270+ service center network.

## Response

No public response from Ultra Tune has been documented at the time of the dark web leak site posting. The incident highlights cybersecurity challenges facing large franchise operations in the automotive service industry, where customer and employee personal information is routinely collected and stored across distributed locations.
