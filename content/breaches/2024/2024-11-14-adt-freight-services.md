## Summary

ADT Freight Services, a Melbourne-based international freight forwarder and customs agency, was claimed as a victim by the Sarcoma ransomware gang in November 2024. The company declined to comment on the incident when approached by media.

## Attack Vector

The Sarcoma ransomware group, which emerged in October 2024, breached ADT Freight Services systems. The compromise was discovered on November 14, 2024. Sarcoma employs a double-extortion strategy combining ransomware encryption with data exfiltration to pressure organizations into paying ransoms. Security analysts believe the gang is based in eastern Europe and may have links to another pre-existing group in the region.

## Consumer Impact

ADT Freight Services specializes in air, sea, and road transportation services including motor vehicles, customs brokerage, and international freight forwarding. The breach potentially affects customer shipment information, customs documentation, and business operational data. The company's refusal to comment leaves affected customers uncertain about the scope and impact of the compromise.

## Response

ADT Freight Services declined to respond to requests for comment on the incident. The attack occurred during Sarcoma's rapid emergence period, with the group listing 38 companies on its data leak site by the end of November and concluding 2024 with 58 attacks attributed to its name, making it one of the top 10 most active ransomware actors.
