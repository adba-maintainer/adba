### Summary

Swinburne University of Technology's Sarawak Campus in Malaysia was hit by a RansomHub ransomware attack in late August 2024. The gang claimed to have stolen 366 gigabytes of data including passport scans, student records, bank account details, and university documents. RansomHub listed the campus on its dark web leak site on 30 August 2024, and investigations confirmed that stolen data was subsequently released online.

### What Happened

RansomHub affiliates breached the cyber security systems of Swinburne's Sarawak Campus and exfiltrated 366GB of sensitive data. The attackers shared sample documents as proof, including invoices, completion letters, advanced standing applications, bank account details, blank student information forms, and passport scans of ex-students from Malaysia. Swinburne Australia confirmed the incident, clarifying that there was no impact to Swinburne's Australian campuses.

### Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed highly sensitive student and staff information including:

- Passport numbers and scans
- Bank account details
- Student academic records
- Personal contact information
- Education credentials

Affected students and staff should:

- Monitor passport status and report if used fraudulently
- Check bank accounts for unauthorized activity
- Be alert for phishing targeting students or alumni
- Watch for education fraud using stolen credentials
- Be cautious of scams exploiting knowledge of their studies

International students whose passports were exposed face particular risk of identity fraud.

### Organisational Response

Immediate action was taken to contain the incident, and relevant government authorities in Malaysia were notified within 24 hours. The university's core business system was fully recovered with no further impact to operations. Swinburne confirmed investigations determined that stolen data had been released online. The Melbourne-based university operates the Sarawak Campus in Malaysia as part of its international education network.
