## Summary

Perfection Fresh, one of Australia's largest privately owned fresh produce businesses, confirmed it was targeted by the Sarcoma ransomware group in October 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen 690 gigabytes of data including employee passports and confidential business agreements.

## Attack Vector

The Sarcoma ransomware group breached Perfection Fresh's systems and exfiltrated 690GB of files and SQL databases. Posted on October 10 to the group's leak site, the stolen data includes passport scans of employees and confidential agreements with clients and suppliers. The attack occurred during Sarcoma's emergence with 30 initial victims claiming over 5 terabytes of total data theft.

## Consumer Impact

Perfection Fresh is headquartered in Homebush, NSW, with offices in Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland, employing more than 1,000 employees. The 690GB data theft represents one of the larger breaches in Sarcoma's initial campaign. Exposed employee passport scans create permanent identity theft risk, while leaked confidential client and supplier agreements potentially impact business relationships across the fresh produce supply chain.

## Response

Perfection Fresh confirmed the incident and has been working to address the breach and inform relevant stakeholders. As one of Australia's largest privately owned fresh produce companies, the breach highlights the agricultural sector's vulnerability to ransomware targeting critical food supply chain businesses.
