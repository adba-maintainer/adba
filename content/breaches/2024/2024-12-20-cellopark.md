## Summary

On 20 December 2024, CellOPark users received confusing messages about their accounts being transitioned to a new platform called OPark, sparking data breach concerns. The situation escalated when users received contradictory emails—first announcing the transition, then instructing users to disregard it, followed by confirmation the transition would proceed. CellOPark assured users no private information was compromised but notified the Information Commissioner as a precaution. The incident stemmed from a commercial dispute with the overseas supplier rather than an external cyber attack.

## What Happened

CellOPark, a national parking payment app promoted by Brisbane City Council and used at locations including the University of Sydney, became embroiled in a confusing transition attempt on 20 December 2024. Users received text messages announcing their accounts would be moved to OPark, a new platform. The announcement included test data such as parking locations named "Gotham City" and "Bat Cave" that had been accidentally left in the system.

Hours later, users received a second email claiming the first message was sent without authorization and that OPark was not connected to CellOPark. Shortly after, CellOPark posted on Facebook that the transition would proceed, apologizing for the conflicting information.

The University of Sydney investigated and confirmed the email was sent via CellOPark's legitimate email domain by someone with authorized access, and no external data breach occurred. CellOPark subsequently sought a temporary injunction to halt the OPark transition, indicating the situation arose from a commercial dispute with their overseas supplier.

## Impact on Individuals

No personal data was compromised according to CellOPark's investigation. The incident created confusion and concern among users but did not result in actual data exposure.

## Organisational Response

CellOPark notified the Information Commissioner as a precautionary measure despite concluding no data breach occurred. Brisbane City Council expressed frustration and began reviewing their partnership options with the parking app provider.
