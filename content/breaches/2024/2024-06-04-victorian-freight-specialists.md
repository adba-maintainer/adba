## Attack Vector

GhostR, a financially motivated hacking group, breached Victorian Freight Specialists' server networks on May 26, 2024, and exfiltrated over 846GB of databases. The group engages in cyber extortion via doxing and provided sample data sets including internal SQL database records and screenshots of logon screens to substantiate their claims on criminal forums.

## Consumer Impact

While specific details about affected individuals are not available, the scale of the breach and nature of the stolen SQL databases suggests potential exposure of customer shipping information, business records, and operational data. As of the breach disclosure, the company's website appeared to be offline.

## Response
