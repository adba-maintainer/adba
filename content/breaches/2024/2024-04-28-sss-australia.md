### Summary

SSS Australia, a healthcare products supplier, was targeted by the Hunters International ransomware gang over the Easter long weekend in April 2024. The gang published 67.1 gigabytes of data totaling 60,225 files on their darknet site on 28 April. The stolen data included customer sales files, invoices for medical equipment and medicines, and marketing materials, but SSS confirmed no patient data was impacted.

### What Happened

The Hunters International ransomware gang breached SSS Australia's systems over the Easter long weekend in April 2024. Attackers exfiltrated 67.1GB of data across 60,225 files before posting it to their darknet leak site on 28 April. The leaked information included customer sales records, invoices for equipment and medicines, marketing material, and documents relating to customers in general healthcare, aged care, hospitals, and specialist healthcare environments including prisons.

### Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed business and customer relationship data from healthcare providers, aged care facilities, hospitals, and specialized healthcare settings. While SSS Australia confirmed no patient data was compromised, healthcare providers whose business information was exposed should:

- Be alert for targeted phishing using knowledge of their business relationships with SSS
- Watch for business email compromise scams
- Monitor for potential contract fraud attempts
- Be cautious of suppliers or vendors impersonating SSS Australia

As a distributor to healthcare providers, SSS Australia does not access patient information, which limited the sensitivity of the exposed data.

### Organisational Response

SSS Australia immediately reported the incident to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). The company emphasized that as a distributor, they do not hold or access patient data, and confirmed that no patient information was impacted. SSS Australia worked to notify affected business customers and implement enhanced security measures following the attack.
