## Summary

On 30 January 2024, Elite Supplements, an Australian sports nutrition and supplements retailer with over 80 stores nationwide, discovered a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to online customer data. The breach exposed names, shipping addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of online customers. The company publicly disclosed the incident on 3 February 2024, confirming that no credit card information, payment data, or passwords were compromised.

## What Happened

Elite Supplements detected unauthorized access to its online customer database on 30 January 2024. The cyber attack allowed threat actors to exfiltrate customer contact information and shipping details from the company's e-commerce platform.

The company did not publicly disclose the specific attack vector used to gain access to customer data, the duration of unauthorized access prior to detection, or whether the breach was discovered through internal monitoring systems or external notification.

While the breach compromised personally identifiable information including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical shipping addresses, Elite Supplements confirmed that no financial data was accessed. The company's security architecture apparently segregated payment processing systems from customer contact databases, limiting the scope of the breach.

No threat actor has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack, and Elite Supplements has not attributed the incident to any known hacking group.

## Impact on Individuals

The breach affected online customers of Elite Supplements who had purchased products through the company's e-commerce platform. The exact number of impacted customers was not disclosed, though Elite Supplements operates a substantial online presence alongside its 80+ physical retail locations across Australia.

Compromised information included:
- **Personal identifiers**: Full names
- **Contact information**: Email addresses and phone numbers
- **Shipping details**: Physical mailing addresses

While no financial data or passwords were stolen, the exposed contact information created risks for affected customers including:
- **Phishing attacks**: Increased vulnerability to targeted email and SMS phishing campaigns impersonating Elite Supplements
- **Social engineering**: Threat actors could use shipping addresses and names to create convincing scams
- **Spam and unwanted marketing**: Contact details could be sold to third parties or used for spam campaigns

The company specifically warned customers to "be extra vigilant with communications that appear to be from Elite Supplements," acknowledging the elevated risk of phishing attacks following the breach.

## Organisational Response

Elite Supplements discovered the breach on 30 January 2024 and notified affected customers on the evening of Saturday, 3 February 2024. The company's public disclosure came shortly after 6:00pm on that date.

In their customer communication, Elite Supplements apologized for the incident and urged customers to exercise heightened vigilance when receiving communications appearing to be from the company. The retailer did not publicly disclose whether it offered complimentary identity monitoring services, credit monitoring, or other protective measures to affected customers.

The company, which was founded in 2007 and has grown to become one of Australia's major sports nutrition retailers, expressed regret over the security incident. Elite Supplements did not provide details about remediation measures implemented to prevent future breaches or whether the company engaged external cybersecurity firms to conduct forensic investigation and security hardening.
