### Summary

Myelec Electrical Wholesalers, a Western Australia-based electrical wholesaler, was targeted by the Lynx ransomware gang in August 2024. The attackers claimed to have stolen data including names, email addresses, and confidential business information. Myelec confirmed awareness of the incident but declined further comment.

### What Happened

The Lynx ransomware gang breached Myelec Electrical Wholesalers' systems and stole data including employee contact information and business records. The attack was publicly disclosed on 26 August 2024 when Lynx listed the company on their leak sites alongside screenshots as proof of the breach. A second ransomware group later attempted to sell what appeared to be the same stolen data, which Myelec confirmed was duplicated from the original Lynx incident rather than a new breach.

### Impact on Individuals

The breach exposed employee and customer contact information including names, email addresses, and business details. Affected individuals should be alert for:

- Targeted phishing emails appearing to come from Myelec
- Spam and unwanted marketing using stolen contact information
- Business email compromise attempts targeting customers

### Organisational Response

Myelec Electrical Wholesalers, established in 2006, is a locally owned Western Australian business providing electrical products to domestic, industrial, commercial, mining, and government sectors. The company confirmed awareness of the incident and worked to address the security breach.
