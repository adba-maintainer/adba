### Summary
Suncorp Bank, part of major Australian insurance and banking conglomerate Suncorp Group, experienced a cyber attack in April 2024 where unauthorized third parties gained access to a small number of customer accounts and stole funds. The bank successfully recovered and returned all stolen funds to affected customers—a rare outcome in digital breach cases. Suncorp restricted affected accounts, reset passwords, and activated fraud prevention protocols.

### What Happened
On April 12, 2024, Suncorp Bank disclosed that it was "responding to a third party's attempt to gain unauthorised access to some Suncorp customer accounts." The attack involved unauthorized parties successfully accessing customer banking accounts and transferring funds without authorization.

A Suncorp spokesman confirmed on Friday afternoon (April 12) that only a "small number of customer accounts" were affected. The bank did not disclose specific details about how the attackers gained access to customer accounts, the total amount of funds stolen, or the exact number of affected customers.

The incident occurred during a significant transition period for Suncorp Bank, as its acquisition by ANZ Banking Group was pending final regulatory approval. The proposed merger would integrate Suncorp Bank's systems with ANZ, making the combined entity Australia's third-largest home loan lender.

### Impact on Individuals
The breach affected a small number of Suncorp Bank customers whose accounts were accessed by unauthorized third parties. While the bank did not disclose specific data types compromised, the unauthorized access enabled actual fund theft, suggesting attackers obtained sufficient authentication credentials to perform transactions.

Potential impacts included:
- **Direct financial loss**: Funds were stolen from customer accounts (though subsequently recovered)
- **Account disruption**: Affected customers had their accounts restricted during investigation and remediation
- **Password changes**: All affected customers were required to reset passwords
- **Temporary loss of access**: Account restrictions may have prevented customers from accessing their own funds during the incident response

However, the impact was significantly mitigated by Suncorp's successful fund recovery. The bank stated: "A small number of customer accounts which have been affected have been restricted, passwords reset, and where necessary, funds have been returned."

The successful recovery and return of all stolen funds represented an unusually positive outcome for victims of financial cyber crime, where stolen funds are typically difficult or impossible to recover once transferred.

### Organisational Response
Suncorp Bank responded swiftly to contain the breach and protect affected customers:

**Immediate actions:**
- Restricted all affected customer accounts to prevent further unauthorized transactions
- Reset passwords for compromised accounts
- Activated fraud prevention and monitoring protocols
- Located and recovered stolen funds

**Fund recovery:**
In a notable achievement, Suncorp successfully traced the stolen funds and returned them to affected account holders in full. This outcome is rare in cyber attacks on financial institutions, where stolen funds typically move through multiple accounts or cryptocurrency exchanges, making recovery nearly impossible.

**Customer notification:**
Suncorp notified affected customers directly and disclosed the incident publicly on April 12, 2024. The bank emphasized that only a small number of accounts were impacted and that remediation was already underway.

**Limited transparency:**
The bank did not publicly disclose:
- The exact number of affected customers
- The total amount of funds stolen and recovered
- The specific attack vector or authentication method compromised
- Whether the breach involved credential stuffing, phishing, or exploitation of a technical vulnerability

This limited disclosure is common in financial institution breaches, where banks balance transparency obligations with concerns about revealing security vulnerabilities or encouraging similar attacks.

The incident demonstrated effective fraud detection and response capabilities, with Suncorp identifying the unauthorized access, containing the breach, and recovering funds relatively quickly. However, the lack of detail about the attack method prevented affected customers and the broader public from understanding what security measures could prevent similar incidents.
