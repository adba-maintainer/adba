## Summary

Road Distribution Services (RDS), a Western Australian logistics and transport company based in Kewdale, was listed as a victim by the newly emerged Sarcoma ransomware group on October 10, 2024. The attack was part of Sarcoma's debut campaign targeting multiple Australian businesses.

## Attack Vector

The Sarcoma ransomware gang breached RDS systems during the group's emergence in October 2024. Sarcoma distinguishes itself by not publicly listing ransom amounts, instead leveraging data leak threats as the primary means of coercion. The group employs a double-extortion strategy, exfiltrating sensitive information and threatening public exposure if ransoms are not paid.

## Consumer Impact

RDS is a small company employing between 2 to 10 individuals, specializing in comprehensive freight solutions with operations centered in Kewdale, a strategic transport hub in Western Australia. The breach potentially exposed customer shipment data, operational logistics information, and business records. As one of four Australian companies targeted by Sarcoma in its initial campaign, RDS represents the group's focus on small-to-medium enterprises across various sectors.

## Response

No public response from Road Distribution Services has been documented. The attack occurred during Sarcoma's dramatic emergence with 30 victims listed simultaneously, claiming over 5 terabytes of total stolen data across all targets. Sarcoma reported 41 incidents in October 2024 alone.
