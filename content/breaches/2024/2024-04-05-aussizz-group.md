### Summary

The DragonForce ransomware gang claimed to have stolen almost 300GB of data from Aussizz Group, an Australian immigration consultancy and global education firm. The gang listed Aussizz on its darknet leak site on 5 April 2024 and published all 278.91 gigabytes on 19 April after ransom negotiations failed. The leaked data included visa details, passport information, employment agreements, skill assessments, and highly sensitive immigration documents.

### What Happened

The DragonForce ransomware gang breached Aussizz Group's systems and exfiltrated 278.91GB of highly sensitive immigration and personal documentation. The gang initially listed Aussizz on their darknet site on 5 April with a ransom deadline of 19 April 2024. When negotiations failed, DragonForce published the entire dataset, which included thousands of records containing visa applications, passport scans, employment agreements, skill assessments, union consultations, and other immigration-related documents.

### Impact on Individuals

This breach is particularly severe due to the highly sensitive nature of immigration documentation. The exposed data includes:

- Passport numbers and scans
- Visa application details
- Employment agreements and contracts
- Skill assessment documents
- Personal identification information
- Immigration status details

Affected individuals should immediately:

- Monitor passport status and report any fraudulent use to authorities
- Be extremely alert for immigration fraud targeting their specific visa status
- Watch for identity theft using the combination of passport and employment data
- Be cautious of scams impersonating immigration officials who know their case details
- Consider if they need to inform employers about potential employment document exposure
- Report any suspicious immigration-related communications to the Department of Home Affairs

The exposure of complete immigration files creates severe risk of identity theft, immigration fraud, and targeted scams exploiting detailed knowledge of individuals' visa status and personal circumstances.

### Organisational Response

Aussizz Group reported the potential data breach and engaged relevant government agencies. The company provided regular updates to the National Cyber Security Coordinator, with collaborative efforts involving the National Office of Cyber Security, relevant Commonwealth, state and territory agencies. ID Support NSW acknowledged the incident as of 30 April 2024. Aussizz Group is an Australia-based global education consultancy and immigration firm offering visa and citizenship applications for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, and UK.
