### Summary

Australian Catholic University disclosed in June 2019 that staff details had been stolen following a phishing attack that compromised university systems. The breach exposed employment information and personal details of ACU employees after attackers successfully tricked staff members into providing credentials. The incident highlighted the ongoing vulnerability of universities to social engineering attacks targeting their large, distributed workforces.

### What Happened

**Phishing.** Cybercriminals sent convincing phishing emails to ACU staff members that appeared to come from legitimate university sources. When employees clicked on malicious links and entered their login credentials, the attackers gained access to ACU's internal systems. Once inside the network, the attackers navigated to databases containing staff employment information, personal details, and potentially payroll data. The phishing campaign demonstrated how attackers exploit the trust relationships within university environments, where staff regularly receive and respond to internal communications. ACU discovered the breach during security monitoring and immediately launched an incident response.

### Impact on Individuals

* **Employment Data Theft:** Staff job titles, departments, work histories, and contact details compromised
* **Personal Information:** Names, email addresses, phone numbers, and potentially home addresses exposed
* **Credential Compromise:** Login details for university systems potentially stolen
* **Identity Theft Risk:** Combination of employment and personal data useful for fraud
* **Targeted Phishing:** Stolen information enabled more sophisticated future attacks on staff
* **Privacy Concerns:** Information about employment at a religious institution potentially sensitive for some staff

University staff data is particularly valuable to attackers because it provides detailed organisational information useful for further social engineering campaigns.

### Response

ACU immediately secured the compromised systems and forced password resets for affected accounts. The university notified all potentially impacted staff members and reported the breach to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. ACU engaged cybersecurity experts to conduct a full forensic investigation and assess the extent of data exfiltration. The university implemented enhanced email security measures including improved phishing detection, multi-factor authentication for sensitive systems, and additional security awareness training for staff. ACU also reviewed its incident response procedures and data access controls. The breach prompted broader discussions within Australia's higher education sector about the increasing sophistication of phishing attacks targeting universities and the need for mandatory security training for all staff and students who access institutional systems.
