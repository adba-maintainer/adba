### Summary

Toyota Australia confirmed in February 2019 that it had been subjected to a cyberattack that forced the company to take down its email systems and other internal infrastructure. The attack, described as an attempted cyber ransom, disrupted Toyota's Australian operations although the company stated it had refused to pay any ransom demand. The incident highlighted the increasing threat of ransomware attacks targeting major corporations and their supply chains.

### What Happened

**Ransomware.** Cybercriminals launched a ransomware attack against Toyota Australia's IT infrastructure, attempting to encrypt systems and extort money from the automotive giant. Toyota responded by immediately taking affected systems offline, including email and other internal platforms, to prevent the ransomware from spreading further across the network. The company's quick response limited the damage, though it caused operational disruptions. Toyota Australia confirmed it did not pay the ransom demand, following cybersecurity best practices that discourage payments which fund further criminal activity. The attack occurred during a period of rising ransomware incidents targeting major corporations.

### Impact on Individuals

* **Customer Data Uncertain:** Toyota did not disclose whether customer information was accessed or compromised
* **Service Disruptions:** Potential delays in customer service, sales, or after-sales support during system downtime
* **Supply Chain Concerns:** Questions about security across automotive industry supply chains
* **Employee Impact:** Internal communications and business systems disrupted

The full extent of customer impact remained unclear, though Toyota's rapid response likely minimised data exposure.

### Response

Toyota Australia immediately isolated affected systems to contain the attack and prevent further spread of the ransomware. The company engaged cybersecurity experts to investigate the breach, assess any data compromise, and safely restore systems from backups. Toyota publicly confirmed the attack and stated it had refused to pay the ransom, sending a strong message about not negotiating with cybercriminals. The company worked to restore email and other systems while maintaining business continuity through alternative channels. Toyota conducted a comprehensive security review and implemented enhanced protective measures. The incident was part of a broader pattern of ransomware attacks on major Australian organisations during 2019, prompting increased focus on cyber resilience across the automotive and manufacturing sectors.
