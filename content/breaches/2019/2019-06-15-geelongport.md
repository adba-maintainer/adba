### Summary

GeelongPort, the operator of Victoria's second-largest port, disclosed in June 2019 that it had suffered a cyberattack resulting in a data breach of electronically stored information including visitor induction records and driver's license details. The breach compromised personal information of people who had undergone safety inductions to access the commercial port facility, raising concerns about security at critical maritime infrastructure.

### What Happened

**Hacking.** Cybercriminals gained unauthorised access to GeelongPort's IT systems and exfiltrated data including visitor induction records. The stolen information contained names, contact details, and copies of driver's licenses that visitors had provided as identification when completing mandatory safety inductions before entering the port facility. Port facilities require strict security protocols and comprehensive visitor tracking, meaning the database likely contained detailed records of who had accessed the site, when, and for what purpose. The breach of a critical infrastructure operator raised concerns about cybersecurity across Australia's ports and maritime sector.

### Impact on Individuals

* **Driver's License Compromise:** State-issued identity documents exposed, creating identity theft risk
* **Visitor Records:** Detailed logs of port visits potentially revealing business activities or employment
* **Critical Infrastructure Access:** Information about who had accessed the port facility compromised
* **Contact Details:** Names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses stolen
* **Business Intelligence:** For commercial visitors, the data could reveal shipping activities or business relationships

The compromise of driver's license information was particularly concerning given these documents' value for identity fraud.

### Response

GeelongPort immediately launched an investigation into the cyberattack and engaged cybersecurity experts to assess the breach and secure systems. The port operator notified all affected individuals whose information had been compromised and reported the incident to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. GeelongPort implemented enhanced cybersecurity measures and reviewed its data retention policies for visitor records. The company advised affected individuals to monitor for potential identity theft and to be alert for phishing attempts. The breach prompted broader reviews of cybersecurity practices across Australia's ports and maritime sector, with federal agencies examining whether additional security measures were needed for critical infrastructure operators handling sensitive visitor and cargo data.
