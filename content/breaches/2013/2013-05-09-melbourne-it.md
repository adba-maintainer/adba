### Summary
Melbourne IT, a major Australian domain registrar and web hosting provider, was attacked by hackers who compromised its DNS infrastructure. The attack was part of a coordinated campaign targeting multiple domain registrars and was connected to efforts to disrupt Twitter's DNS services.

### What Happened
In May 2013, an unauthorised third party gained access to Melbourne IT's systems. A hacking group calling itself "Hack the Planet" claimed responsibility for breaching Melbourne IT alongside two other domain registrars: Xinnet and Moniker. The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the domain registration infrastructure to manipulate DNS records.

The attack was linked to a broader campaign targeting major internet services. The Australian Federal Police later arrested individuals connected to the Anonymous collective who were allegedly involved in multiple attacks on Melbourne IT during 2012 and 2013.

### Impact on Individuals
While Melbourne IT initially described the incident as minor, the attack affected the DNS infrastructure used by multiple high-profile clients. DNS attacks can redirect users to malicious websites, intercept communications, or cause service outages for businesses and their customers. However, no direct consumer personal data was reported as compromised in the attack.

### Organisational Response
Melbourne IT acknowledged the security incident and worked with law enforcement agencies including the Australian Federal Police to investigate the breach. The AFP subsequently made arrests of individuals allegedly involved in the hacking campaign. The incident highlighted vulnerabilities in domain registrar security infrastructure and prompted reviews of security practices across the industry.
