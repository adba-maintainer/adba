## What Happened

On 7 December 2023, the University of Wollongong detected a cyber incident affecting its systems. The university's cybersecurity team moved quickly to contain the breach and prevent further unauthorised access.

The attack targeted systems containing personal information of both staff and students. While the university acted swiftly to contain the incident, it acknowledged that data was likely accessed by unauthorised third parties during the breach window.
