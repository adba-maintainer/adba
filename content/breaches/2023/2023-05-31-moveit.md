### Summary
A critical zero-day vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software was exploited by the CL0P ransomware gang. This software was used by hundreds of Australian organizations to transfer sensitive data.

### Impact
Because this was a supply-chain attack, the attackers did not hack the companies directly. They intercepted files being transferred by the vendor.
