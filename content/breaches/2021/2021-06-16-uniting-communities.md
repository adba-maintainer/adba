## Summary

Uniting Communities, a South Australian community services organisation, disclosed it was investigating a possible data breach following a cybersecurity incident in June 2021. The organisation provides support services across South Australia and was working to determine if client data had been compromised.

## What Happened

In mid-June 2021, Uniting Communities detected a cybersecurity incident affecting its systems. The organisation immediately began investigating to determine the nature and extent of the incident, including whether any personal data had been accessed by unauthorised parties.

Uniting Communities provides various community support services including financial counselling, emergency relief, and support for vulnerable populations, meaning its systems could contain sensitive personal information about clients.

## Impact on Individuals

The potential impact remained unclear during the investigation. Depending on what systems were affected, the breach could have exposed personal information of clients who had accessed community support services.

## Organisational Response

Uniting Communities engaged cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and determine whether data had been compromised. The organisation worked to assess the scope of the incident and identify any affected individuals who would need to be notified.
