## Summary

A Tasmanian State Growth Department employee allegedly passed personal information of approximately 260 drivers to a debt collection agency without authorisation. The insider breach involved accessing government databases and disclosing driver details for non-official purposes.

## What Happened

In 2021, a Tasmanian State Growth Department employee with access to driver licence databases allegedly used their position to obtain personal information of drivers and pass it to a debt collection agency. The employee accessed confidential government records containing driver details including addresses and contact information.

The breach came to light when authorities became aware that driver information had been improperly disclosed. Investigation revealed that the employee had systematically accessed records of approximately 260 drivers and provided this information to third parties.

## Impact on Individuals

The 260 affected Tasmanian drivers had their personal information improperly disclosed, including:

- Driver licence details
- Home addresses
- Phone numbers
- Other personal information held in government records

This information was then used by a debt collection agency, meaning affected individuals potentially received contact from debt collectors based on improperly obtained government data.

## Organisational Response

The matter was referred to law enforcement for criminal investigation. The employee was charged with offences related to unauthorised access and disclosure of personal information held in government systems.

## Legal Action

**Criminal Proceedings**

The former State Growth worker faced criminal charges for the unauthorised disclosure of personal information. Court proceedings resulted in the employee avoiding jail time, though other penalties were applied. The case highlighted the serious consequences of insider threats within government agencies with access to sensitive personal data.
