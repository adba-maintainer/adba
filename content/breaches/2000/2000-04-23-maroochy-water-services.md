### Summary
A former contractor for Maroochy Shire Council launched a cyber attack against the sewage control system, releasing over one million litres of untreated sewage into local parks, rivers and stormwater drains. This incident is recognised as the first documented cyber attack on critical infrastructure causing environmental damage.

### What Happened
Vitek Boden, a former employee of Hunter Watertech who had worked on the Maroochy SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) project, used a laptop computer and radio transmitter to remotely access and control 150 sewage pumping stations. After being rejected for employment with Maroochy Shire Council in January 2000, Boden launched the attack as revenge.

Between February and April 2000, Boden drove around the Maroochy area on at least 46 occasions, issuing radio commands to sewage equipment. By compromising the wireless control systems, he was able to manipulate pumping stations and release raw sewage into the environment.

The attack was discovered on 23 April 2000 when Boden was pulled over during a routine traffic stop and police noticed computer and radio equipment in his vehicle.

### Impact on Individuals
While no personal data was compromised, local residents and the environment suffered significant harm:

- **Environmental damage:** Over one million litres of raw sewage was released into local waterways, parks and rivers
- **Health risks:** Marine life died, creek water turned black, and unbearable odours affected residents
- **Community disruption:** Public spaces became contaminated and unusable during the incident
- **Economic impact:** The attack cost Maroochy Shire Council $176,000 in emergency response, environmental clean-up, monitoring and enhanced security measures

### Legal Action
In November 2001, Vitek Boden was sentenced to two years in prison for unauthorised access to computer systems. He was also required to pay compensation for the damage caused. Hunter Watertech, his former employer, incurred over $500,000 in costs responding to the incident.

This case is widely studied in cybersecurity as the first confirmed example of a malicious cyber attack on industrial control systems causing real-world physical harm. It demonstrated the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems and highlighted the potential for cyber attacks to cause damage beyond data theft.
