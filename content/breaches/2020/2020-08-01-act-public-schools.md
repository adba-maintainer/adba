Students gained unauthorised access to the ACT public schools network and used this access to send graphic inappropriate content to children across multiple ACT schools.

### What Happened

Students exploited weak security controls in the ACT Education Directorate's network to gain elevated access privileges. Once inside the network, they sent inappropriate and graphic content via the school email system to students across multiple schools in the territory.

The incident involved insider threat from students who found ways to bypass network restrictions and abuse their access. The content distributed was described as graphic and inappropriate for children, causing distress to recipients and their families.

### Impact on Individuals

Students who received the inappropriate content experienced distress and potential psychological harm. The incident raised serious questions about network security, content filtering, and access controls in the education system.

### Organisational Response

The ACT Education Directorate investigated the incident and strengthened network access controls. The students responsible faced disciplinary action. The incident highlighted the need for robust security even for internal school networks and the importance of proper access management to prevent abuse by insiders.
