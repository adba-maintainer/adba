The Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) found that confidential details of the entire Western Australia Police Force had been accessed in what was described as a "startling" audit breach.

### What Happened

A CCC investigation revealed that an internal audit had resulted in unauthorised access to confidential personnel information of all WA Police Force members. The breach occurred through internal processes rather than external hacking, but exposed sensitive employee data across the entire organisation.

The investigation found that personnel records, which should have been restricted to authorised human resources staff, were accessed more broadly during the audit process. This included personal details, employment records, and potentially sensitive information about police officers and staff.

### Impact on Individuals

WA Police officers and staff faced potential privacy violations and risks if their personal information was misused. For law enforcement personnel, the exposure of personal details carries particular risks given the nature of their work and potential for targeting by criminal elements.

### Organisational Response

The CCC's findings led to recommendations for improved data governance and access controls within WA Police. The incident prompted a review of internal audit procedures and highlighted the need for strict controls over access to sensitive personnel information within government agencies.
