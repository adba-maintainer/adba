I.M.L., the parent company of adult entertainment platform ImLive and affiliate network PussyCash, suffered a data breach exposing highly sensitive personal information of performers including Australians, compromising identity documents and financial details.

### What Happened

A security breach at I.M.L. exposed sensitive personal information of cam models and performers who worked through ImLive and the PussyCash affiliate network. The leaked database contained identity documents, payment information, and personal details submitted during performer verification processes.

The exposed data included scanned copies of government-issued IDs (driver's licences, passports), names, addresses, dates of birth, email addresses, and banking details. For adult entertainment performers, this represented an extremely serious privacy violation given the stigma associated with the industry and many performers' efforts to maintain privacy.

### Impact on Individuals

The breach created severe risks for performers including identity theft from exposed government IDs, financial fraud from banking details, and potentially life-altering doxxing if their real identities were connected to their performer personas. Many adult entertainers work under pseudonyms to protect their privacy and safety. The exposure could lead to harassment, discrimination, blackmail, or violence.

For Australian performers affected, the risks were particularly acute given the relatively small population and potential for identification.

### Organisational Response

I.M.L. addressed the security vulnerability that led to the exposure. The incident highlighted the critical responsibility adult entertainment platforms have to protect performers' identity information, and the potentially devastating consequences when verification data is inadequately secured.
