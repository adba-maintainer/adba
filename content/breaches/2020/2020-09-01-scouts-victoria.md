Scouts Victoria suffered a hacking incident that potentially exposed sensitive personal information of approximately 900 people, including bank details, birth certificates, and court orders involving children.

### What Happened

Hackers gained unauthorised access to Scouts Victoria's systems and potentially obtained highly sensitive personal information of around 900 individuals including children, parents, and volunteers. The compromised data included not just standard contact information but also bank account details, copies of birth certificates, and in some cases, court orders related to custody arrangements.

The inclusion of court orders and documents related to children made this breach particularly sensitive. Such documents could reveal family law matters, custody arrangements, and other private legal situations that should remain confidential.

### Impact on Individuals

Affected families faced serious risks including identity theft from exposed birth certificates and financial fraud from bank account details. The exposure of court orders created potential safety risks for children in custody disputes and violated the privacy of family law matters. Parents were understandably distressed about their children's information being compromised.

### Organisational Response

Scouts Victoria notified affected individuals and reported the breach to the OAIC as required. The organisation engaged cybersecurity specialists to investigate and strengthen security controls. The incident highlighted the particular duty of care youth organisations have to protect children's information and the need for enhanced security when handling sensitive legal documents.
