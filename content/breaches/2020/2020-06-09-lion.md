Lion, one of Australia's largest drinks manufacturers producing popular beer brands, shut down IT systems after a cyber incident that disrupted production and led to beer shortages across the country.

### What Happened

Lion detected a cyber security incident and immediately shut down IT systems across its Australian and New Zealand operations to contain the threat. The incident, widely reported as ransomware, affected the company's ability to manufacture and distribute products including XXXX, Tooheys, and James Squire beers.

The attack forced Lion to operate with minimal IT support, disrupting production schedules, inventory management, and distribution logistics. The timing was particularly problematic as it occurred during winter when beer consumption typically increases. Media reports indicated some beer supplies were delayed or unavailable at retailers.

### Impact on Individuals

The primary impact was on consumers experiencing product shortages and on Lion employees who had to work with manual processes while systems were restored. The extent of personal data exposure, if any, was not publicly disclosed.

### Organisational Response

Lion worked with cybersecurity specialists and law enforcement to investigate the incident and restore systems. The company communicated with retail partners about supply disruptions and worked to resume normal production. The incident highlighted the real-world impact of cyber attacks on manufacturing and supply chains, with tangible effects on consumers.
