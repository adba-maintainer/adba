A massive leaked database from Chinese technology company Zhenhua Data revealed extensive surveillance of over 35,000 Australians including politicians, military personnel, business leaders, and academics as part of a global intelligence gathering operation.

### What Happened

A database belonging to Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Technology was leaked, exposing a massive global surveillance and intelligence gathering operation. The database contained 2.4 billion records on individuals worldwide, with over 35,000 detailed profiles of Australians.

The Australian targets included federal and state politicians, military and intelligence personnel, business executives, academics, and other prominent individuals. The database aggregated information from social media, professional networks, court records, leaked data breaches, and other open and clandestine sources to build comprehensive profiles.

Zhenhua Data has reported links to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. The database appeared designed to support intelligence operations, influence campaigns, and strategic decision-making by providing detailed dossiers on individuals of interest.

### Impact on Individuals

Australians profiled in the database faced serious risks including targeted surveillance, potential coercion or recruitment attempts, blackmail using personal information, and compromise of sensitive government or business operations. The comprehensive nature of the profiles—combining professional, personal, and social information—enabled sophisticated targeting.

Military and intelligence personnel faced operational security risks. Politicians could be targeted for influence operations. Business leaders' information could support economic espionage. The pervasive surveillance represented a significant threat to Australian national security and individual privacy.

### Organisational Response

The Australian Government acknowledged the reports but provided limited public comment given the national security implications. Intelligence agencies analysed the database to understand the scope of Chinese intelligence collection on Australian targets. The incident prompted heightened awareness about foreign intelligence operations and the aggregation of open-source data for surveillance purposes.
