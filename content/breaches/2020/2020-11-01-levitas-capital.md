Sydney-based hedge fund Levitas Capital was hacked as part of a sophisticated $170 million international cybercrime spree targeting financial institutions.

### What Happened

Levitas Capital was compromised as part of a coordinated international hacking campaign that targeted multiple financial institutions worldwide. The attackers demonstrated sophisticated techniques to breach hedge fund systems and access sensitive financial information and client data.

The breach was part of a larger criminal operation that netted approximately $170 million across multiple victims globally. The targeting of hedge funds indicated the attackers had knowledge of the financial sector and were specifically seeking high-value targets.

### Impact on Individuals
