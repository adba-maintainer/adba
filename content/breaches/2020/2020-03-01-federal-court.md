The Federal Court of Australia inadvertently made public the names of protection visa applicants in a data breach that could have endangered vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees.

### What Happened

A configuration error in the Federal Court's electronic case management system resulted in the public disclosure of names of individuals who had applied for protection visas. These individuals' identities were meant to be suppressed to protect their safety and privacy, as many fled persecution in their home countries.

The breach occurred through the court's online database, which mistakenly made accessible documents that should have remained confidential. Protection visa applicants' names appeared in searchable court records despite suppression orders designed to protect their identities.

### Impact on Individuals

The exposure of protection visa applicants' identities created serious safety risks. Many asylum seekers and refugees fled persecution and revealing their identities could endanger them or their families in their countries of origin. The breach could also impact ongoing legal proceedings and individuals' mental wellbeing, as they relied on the court system to protect their confidentiality.

### Organisational Response

The Federal Court of Australia acknowledged the breach and took immediate steps to remove the exposed information from public access. The court reviewed its procedures for handling suppressed information and implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents. The breach highlighted the critical importance of protecting vulnerable individuals' identities within the legal system.
