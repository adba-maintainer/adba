Talman, an Australian software provider for the wool industry, was hit by a ransomware attack that brought wool sales across Australia to a standstill, disrupting a critical agricultural sector.

### What Happened

Ransomware attackers compromised Talman's systems, which provide auction and cataloguing software used throughout the Australian wool industry. The attack forced the shutdown of Talman's systems, preventing wool auctions from proceeding normally. Wool brokers and auction houses across Australia were unable to process sales, creating significant disruption to the agricultural supply chain.

The ransomware encrypted critical systems required for wool lot cataloguing, bidding, and sales processing. Without access to these systems, the industry was forced to halt or significantly delay wool auctions while Talman worked to restore services.

### Impact on Individuals

While the breach primarily affected businesses rather than individual consumers, wool producers, brokers, and auction houses experienced operational disruptions and potential financial losses due to delayed sales. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of critical industry infrastructure to ransomware attacks.

### Organisational Response

Talman worked to restore systems from backups and engaged cybersecurity experts to remediate the attack. The company communicated with affected clients throughout the incident and implemented additional security measures to prevent future attacks. The incident prompted broader discussions within the agricultural sector about cybersecurity resilience and business continuity planning.
