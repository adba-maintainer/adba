IN SPORT, a sporting goods retailer, had its head office systems hit by ransomware, resulting in data loss during the recovery process.

### What Happened

Ransomware attackers compromised IN SPORT's head office IT systems, encrypting files and demanding payment. The company chose not to pay the ransom and instead rebuilt systems from backups. However, some data was lost in the process as not all information could be recovered from backup systems.

The attack disrupted corporate operations, though the impact on retail stores was limited. The incident highlighted the challenges small and medium retailers face in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses and comprehensive backup strategies.

### Impact on Individuals

While the breach primarily affected business operations, some customer data may have been among the information lost during the system rebuild. The extent of customer data exposure or loss was not publicly disclosed.

### Organisational Response

IN SPORT worked to restore systems and resume normal operations. The company acknowledged that some data was permanently lost during the recovery process, underscoring the importance of comprehensive backup and disaster recovery planning.
