A large Australian education data leak was traced to K7Maths, a third-party mathematics education service used by schools, with AusCERT confirming the data was not from government systems.

### What Happened

A significant data leak affecting Australian students and teachers was traced to K7Maths, an online mathematics learning platform used by numerous Australian schools. The exposed data included personal information of students and educators who used the service.

AusCERT (Australian Cyber Emergency Response Team) investigated and confirmed the leaked data came from the third-party education service rather than government education systems. The incident highlighted the risks of education technology platforms that collect student data.

### Impact on Individuals

Students and teachers using K7Maths faced potential privacy violations from the exposure of their personal information. While specific details about the volume and sensitivity of exposed data were limited, education data typically includes names, ages, email addresses, and sometimes performance information.

### Organisational Response

K7Maths addressed the exposure once identified. Schools using the platform were notified. The incident demonstrated the need for education institutions to carefully vet and monitor third-party education technology providers that handle student data.
