The Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron faced questioning by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) following a data breach affecting member information.

### What Happened

The Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron experienced a data breach that prompted an OAIC investigation. Limited details about the nature of the breach, the data exposed, or the attack vector were made public.

The incident involved member information held by the prestigious yacht club, potentially including names, contact details, and membership records.

### Impact on Individuals

Members faced potential privacy violations and risks of phishing or targeted attacks using exposed contact information. The full extent of impact remained unclear due to limited public disclosure.

### Organisational Response

The yacht squadron cooperated with the OAIC investigation. The incident demonstrated that even smaller organisations and membership-based clubs face data breach risks and regulatory scrutiny under Australia's privacy laws.
